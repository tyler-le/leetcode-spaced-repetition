# Privacy Policy for LeetCode Spaced Repetition Extension

**Last Updated:** December 2024

This privacy policy describes how the LeetCode Spaced Repetition Chrome extension collects, uses, and stores your data.

## Data Collection

The extension collects the following data:

- **Current LeetCode page URLs** when you visit problem pages (to identify which problem you're viewing)
- **Problem titles and numbers** extracted from LeetCode pages (for tracking purposes)
- **Confidence ratings (1-5)** that you manually log for each problem attempt
- **Timestamps** of your practice sessions and confidence ratings
- **Your preference settings** (e.g., maximum problems per day)

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). No data is transmitted to external servers, cloud services, or third parties.

## Data Usage

The collected data is used solely for the following purposes:

- Track which LeetCode problems you've practiced
- Calculate spaced repetition review schedules based on your confidence ratings
- Display your practice history and upcoming review dates in the extension popup
- Provide notifications when you log confidence ratings (optional, if notifications are enabled)

## Data Sharing

**Your data is not shared with any parties.** 

We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to:
- External servers or cloud services
- Third-party services or APIs
- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Data brokers or aggregators
- Any other parties, organizations, or individuals

**All data remains on your device and is accessible only to you.** The extension operates entirely locally and does not transmit data outside of your browser.

## Data Control

You have full control over your data:

- **View your data**: All tracked problems are visible in the extension popup's "All Problems" tab
- **Delete your data**: You can delete all your data at any time through the extension's Settings tab by clicking "Clear All Data". This will permanently remove all stored problem data and reset settings to defaults.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's local storage, your data is protected by your browser's security mechanisms. We do not have access to your data, and it cannot be accessed by external parties.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when changes were made. Continued use of the extension after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated privacy policy.

## Contact

For questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please visit the extension's GitHub repository or open an issue.

**Summary**: This extension stores your LeetCode practice data locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or share your data with any external parties.
